/**
 * Phase 18 rewrote the scheduler. It used to replay every round from scratch:
 * sort by points at the start of a round, pair adjacently. With a group size the
 * user can change mid-run that replay reconstructs a schedule that was never
 * shown, so the next group is now derived from the state of the log instead:
 *
 *   1. candidates sorted by (opponents faced asc, points desc, upload order asc)
 *   2. the seed is the first candidate still short of its planned opponents
 *   3. fill up to k with candidates that have not met anyone already picked
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing. Points now update inside a round, so the order
 * of questions differs slightly from the old pairing even at k=2. And a track
 * left out of an uneven group is the one with the fewest opponents, so it heads
 * the next group automatically — no more byes that quietly cost a comparison.
